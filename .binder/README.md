# Binder files

This folder contains `environment.yml` which is needed to configure a Docker image on Binder with the requisite packages. It is simply a link to `osca.yml` in the main repository.

It also contains `apt.txt`, which list libraries needed for [opencv-python](https://exerror.com/importerror-libgl-so-1-cannot-open-shared-object-file-no-such-file-or-directory/).
