# Extra analyses

This folder contains code for additional analyses that were developed and run 
on the Credit Assignment project data.  

Some of these are exploratory or preliminary, and the code has not been 
systematically tidied up for ease of sharing. Also, although I of course strive 
to keep my code bug-free, this code has not been as systematically debugged as 
the main paper code.  

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have questions or need any help using these 
scripts.
